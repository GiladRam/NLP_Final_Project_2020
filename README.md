# IDC NLP Final Project 2020 - Unified summarization model

IDC NLP course Final project 2020
In this reposetory I evaluated and tested the basic building block of unified summarization made by 
the following paper: [A Unified Model for Extractive and Abstractive Summarization using Inconsistency Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06266)

#### The repository has 4 main notebooks for code usage and discovery:
* data preperation - 
* extractor
* abstractor
* unified 


This work is mainly based on the official code base of the paper https://github.com/HsuWanTing/unified-summarization.
